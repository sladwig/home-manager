=== Highlights

This release has the following notable changes:

* All Home Manager modules are now loaded on all platforms. With this
change you will get a more descriptive error message if you attempt to
enable a module that is incompatible with the host platform.
+
Previously, modules that were platform specific would only be loaded
on that particular platform. For example, a module defining a
https://systemd.io/[systemd] service would only be loaded when the
host platform was Linux. This reduced evaluation times, simplified the
generated documentation, and made it impossible to accidentally use
modules that do not support the host platform.
+
While the above benefits are quite nice, avoiding module loads also
brings a few problems. For example, the
https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/[public documentation]
will only show the options available for Linux hosts and the
documentation cannot make references to options within modules that
are unavailable on some hosts. Finally, users who wish to use the same
configuration file for different platforms cannot do so, even if the
platform incompatible options are unused.
+
Ultimately, the benefits of loading all modules won and the behavior
has now changed. For associated discussion see
